    <h1>Vault Catalog</h1>
    <p>Welcome Charlotte and Grampy!</p>

    <h2>Silver Nickels</h2>
    <p>
        Deep in the training vault there is a small velvet tray holding a stack of
        shiny silver nickels. Each nickel is a “thinking token” that you can only
        earn by solving puzzles, fixing problems, or trying something brave and new
    </p>

        <img src="nickel.jpg" width="300">
        When Charlotte and Grampy open the vault and see the silver nickels glowing
        in the light, it means they have unlocked a new piece of the story and a new
        skill in the real world.
