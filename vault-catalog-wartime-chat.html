    <h2>Silver Nickels</h2>
    <p>
        Deep in the training vault there is a small velvet tray holding a stack of
        shiny silver nickels. Each nickel is a “valuable” that you can only
        earn by Valuable
Go to Grampy’s house,

        When Charlotte and Grampy open the vault and see the silver nickels glowing
        in the light, it means they have unlocked a new piece of the story and a new
        skill in the real world.
